## Running it locally

1. **Start the server**

Start a REPL with your prefered approach (this project uses tools.deps). From the REPL you can start the server by running the go function in the user namespace:

``` clojure
user=> (go)
```

2. **Start CLJS compilation**

``` sh
$ yarn start
```

3. **Open browser**

And point it to `http://localhost:8080`
